# Emotion Classification Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of Course COMP544DL at Msc Data Science UNIC in collaboration with Loucas Sialis & Neophytos Petrou.

The objective of this project was to design, train, and evaluate a
machine learning model capable of performing emotion classification from
textual data. The implementation follows the specifications and academic
requirements defined within the course framework.

## Repository Contents

-   train.csv → Training dataset used for model development
-   Project.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing,
    model training, and prediction on new data
-   Report.docx → Final project report including methodology,
    experiments, and conclusions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone

### 2. Install required dependencies

pip install numpy pandas seaborn nltk pyspellchecker matplotlib scikit-learn

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook

Open: Project.ipynb

Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Notes

-   Ensure that train.csv is located in the same directory as the
    notebook.
-   Ensure you have a test.csv in the same directory with one column named text
